            <br><br>
		“Vulnerable children” is a term used to identify the most at-risk group among young people in contexts such as humanitarian aid 
		and education in developing countries.
		 Orphan and vulnerable children who have either lost one or both parents live in extreme poverty
		 with their guardians with little access to basic needs.
		 After losing one or both of their parents, most of these children are forced to drop out of school to support themselves,
		 their single parents or their guardians who are usually their elder grandparents. 
		Education is the key to a good life. It gives one hope that, after completing the recommended phase,
		one will live a good life and afford the basic needs in life. 
		One way of helping a vulnerable child to live for a better normal life, is by first ensuring s/he gets the basic things like food, shelter,
		clothing then followed by the vital education. 
			<br><br>
		GIFTS AND SMILES(established in 2019) focuses on providing these basic amenities to these underpriveleged children.
		Today we are working with several NGO's in Guwahati City and soon would tie up with NGO's situated at different cities and states across India.
		We dream of a better tomorrow where no kid would be deprived of his/her basic rights.
		Gifts And Smiles is a medium to reach the kids who need our help, who need our support to realise their true potential and become independent citizens of the country.
		Our main mission is to provide a channel through which citizens of the country can come together and help these kids. We believe "ting drops of water make an ocean".
		So even with your small efforts we could build a better and bright India.
